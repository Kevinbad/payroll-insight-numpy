This project demonstrates how to use NumPy for analyzing and generating insights from simulated sales data.
The goal is to showcase practical skills in numerical data manipulation, basic statistics, and automation of calculations using Python.

Project Description

The script generates a fictional sales dataset for a store with the following variables:

unit_price: average price per product.

quantity_sold: number of units sold.

category: product category (1, 2, or 3).

total_revenue: automatically calculated total revenue.

Then, it performs several analyses, such as:

Average revenue by category.

Identification of top-performing products.

Correlation between variables.

Generation of key performance metrics for decision-making.

Skills Demonstrated

Advanced use of NumPy (arrays, broadcasting, aggregate functions).

Vectorized calculations and efficient operations on large datasets.

Descriptive data analysis using Python.

Organized and professional presentation of results.
